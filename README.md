## Welcome to the CodSoft Internship Projects repository!
Here you will find an exciting collection of projects completed during our CodSoft internship program. Each project showcases the creative and technical skills of our talented interns. Let's take a brief tour of some of the standout projects:

## Number Game | Task-1
The Number Guessing Game is a simple yet engaging Java application that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for interns at Codsoft, helping them improve their Java programming skills while creating an interactive and entertaining game.

Technical Details:

The project will be developed using Java programming language.
Object-oriented principles will be followed to organize the code into classes and methods.
Input and output will be managed using standard I/O libraries.
The random number generation will be accomplished using Java's built-in Random class.
Exception handling will be implemented to ensure the program gracefully handles incorrect inputs and unexpected errors.

Features:

1. User Interaction: The game will prompt the player to enter their guess for the secret number.
2. Random Number Generation: The game will generate a random number within a predefined range at the beginning of each round.
3. Guess Validation: The player's input will be validated to ensure it's a valid number within the given range.
4. Feedback Mechanism: After each guess, the player will receive feedback on whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct.
5. Guess Limit: To add an element of challenge, there will be a limit on the number of guesses the player can make per round.
6. Winning Scenario: The player will be informed when they guess the correct number, along with the number of attempts it took.Display the user's score out of     
   100%, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.


## Word Counter | Task-2
The Word Counter Application is a Java project designed to help Codsoft interns enhance their programming skills by creating a useful utility. The project focuses on developing an application that takes a text input and provides users with valuable insights, such as word and character count. This project will provide a hands-on experience in Java programming and input/output handling.

Technical Details:

The project will be developed using Java programming language.
Input and output will be managed using standard I/O libraries.
String manipulation and parsing techniques will be employed to analyze the input text.
Object-oriented programming principles will be followed to structure the code into classes and methods.
Exception handling will be implemented to ensure the program gracefully handles errors or unexpected inputs.

Features:

1. User Input Options: The application will provide users with two options: entering text directly or providing a path to an external text file.
2. File Path Handling: Users can specify the path to a text file they want to analyze. The application will validate the path and read the contents of the file.
3. Word Count: The application will analyze the input text, whether entered directly or read from a file, and calculate the total number of words.
4. Character Count: Alongside word count, the application will calculate the total number of characters, including spaces and punctuation.
5. Average Word Length: The application will compute the average length of words in the input text.
6. Most Frequent Words: The application can be expanded to identify and display a list of the most frequently used words in the input text.
