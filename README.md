## Welcome to the CodSoft Internship Projects repository!
Here you will find an exciting collection of projects completed during our CodSoft internship program. Each project showcases the creative and technical skills of our talented interns. Let's take a brief tour of some of the standout projects:

## Number Game | Task-1
The Number Guessing Game is a simple yet engaging Java application that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for interns at Codsoft, helping them improve their Java programming skills while creating an interactive and entertaining game.

Technical Details:

The project will be developed using Java programming language.
Object-oriented principles will be followed to organize the code into classes and methods.
Input and output will be managed using standard I/O libraries.
The random number generation will be accomplished using Java's built-in Random class.
Exception handling will be implemented to ensure the program gracefully handles incorrect inputs and unexpected errors.

Features:

User Interaction: The game will prompt the player to enter their guess for the secret number.
Random Number Generation: The game will generate a random number within a predefined range at the beginning of each round.

Guess Validation: The player's input will be validated to ensure it's a valid number within the given range.

Feedback Mechanism: After each guess, the player will receive feedback on whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct.

Guess Limit: To add an element of challenge, there will be a limit on the number of guesses the player can make per round.

Winning Scenario: The player will be informed when they guess the correct number, along with the number of attempts it took.Display the user's score out of 100%, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.
